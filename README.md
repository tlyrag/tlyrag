### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thiago Lyra, I've recently decided to make a complete shift in my carrer by moving from a Finance Analyst position to become an Automation Developer. I'm currently using Blue Prism as my main RPA application, but I also have knowledge on Javascript and some frameworks such as Vue, Puppeteer.

* ðŸ”­ I'm currently working at IBM 
* ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python
* âœ¨ I also write gaming reviews/previews and news at [Ultima Ficha](https://www.ultimaficha.com.br/)
